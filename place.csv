ChIJ__9bhVYABDQRX4mZKXW_dmI,The best Japanese restaurant with luxurious Japanese setting. Excellent service and fantastic food. Must try in Lee Gardens. Great chef and restaurant staff.
ChIJkXR3vyP7AzQRB8xJ5uaG_L8,"Ordered the god tier rice omelet, wagyu beef fried rice covered by egg and soy sauce, it tasted alright & it’s satiate.

Paid extra 18 dollars for a hot/cold drink, a miso soup and a soft boiled egg. I think it’s worth the price, the taste of the egg was a bit artificial though. Best come before dinner time to avoid the extra 10% service fee.

Pretty satisfying dinning experience, would like to come again."
ChIJxxzNWiz7AzQR4juFqPO60fo,"Traditional Japanese decoration. From the first bite you can feel the freshness of the food. Very tasty with good quality in the ingredients, staff was very attentive and helping with everything. Menu have a lot of varieties, and all we tried was good."
ChIJr6bLBgX7AzQRdbMpHlgE_N0,Nice food nice place nice environment! Sukiyaki is highly recommended!! It’ s perfect!
ChIJOff0ogP5AzQRpu9PzYQy3Qk,"A small cosy Japanese restaurant. Underrated due to its location but the food there is really fresh and price is very reasonable.
Came here for lunch which their sets ranged from $70-$150. They were and offering buy 1 get 1 lunch set which was a great deal! Portion of the set were reasonable for female. Might be too little for male. But for this price and this quality definitely better than most places."
ChIJK7oMWNP5AzQR1-Jp5mgzAuQ,"Very cozy Japanese restaurant with yummy sushi
Seafood used was fresh"
ChIJMYLlW1b5AzQRV6AH-va6OgA,Nice place for some Japanese BBQ food to enjoy with friends and family. Good location and easy to find. Food was amazing.
ChIJE9kDru_4AzQRn62JU24ajl4,"Good food quality and quantity! The price might be little bit higher compare to restaurants nearby. However, it is definitely worth it. I was amazed by the taste of the black truffle beef when I first tried it. If you haven't been to this restaurant, you must view it asap. It might also be an interesting experience for someone who haven't try this type of barbeque.
The only downsides are that they only accept CASH and the queuing time can take up to an hour especially in the weekend. Highly recommended!!"
ChIJZaIZy9r4AzQR0n98a2NYBV8,"A small hand made sushi restaurant. There is warm welcoming service. The food are served by polite waitresses. The cup, teabags, chopsticks and plates are provided at a self-serviced counter. The food are fresh and delicious. Apart from hot plates and sushi, there is good dessert line fresh fruit sorbet, mochi and mini sweet potatoes. Payment is by cash only."
ChIJb-GAMrz4AzQRFIk1jd3Zz8U,"This branch offers one of the best hotpot that I’ve ever tried in HK.
The spicy soup is very unique and rich in flavor. The AUS meat is very good. The variety of items is acceptable including the drinks and ice cream.
The price is very economic especially during the lunch set."
ChIJh86PxBH5AzQRrFRRVeDCAuI,"There are too few high-quality sushi restaurants in Tsuen Wan. The quality of the food is average. The fish is fresh, the price of lunch is not cheap, and the service is good, but the disadvantage is that the shops are too small and the seats are too crowded, which is not proportional to the charge."
ChIJ90jVkr34AzQRR753GqRZYfc,"Undoubtedly one of the very best Ramen you can find in Hong Kong.  The soup was thick, tasteful, and a perfect match to the noodle.  The slow cooked pork slice was super tender.    I'd recommend adding raw garlic after you took half of the noodle.  That'd add extra layer of flavor the noodle and bring it to the next level."
ChIJq6qabe4ABDQRFtoO7RjhJL4,"This is a small store so it can get busy very quickly since there is only space for one chef to make all the sushi.
Good sushi. Packaged wasabi but it's not horseradish, so it's likely real stuff. Staff were ok considering situation.
Unfortunately they ran out of certain ingredients, which I completely understand. They had a full private room."
ChIJ637sCkABBDQRaUFpiEb74Lo,"I've been here a multiple times prior to the covid-19 outbreak because this place always serves fresh sashimi bowl with a satisfying portion at a reasonable price.  It's no different when I visited again last week.  The toro and sea urchin bowl was filled with minced toro, so much that you can have a good chunk on every bite with the rice.  It comes with additional scallop and shrimp which was a surprise because you usually won't get all these goodies at under $200.  The set comes with a miso soup and ends with a scope of ice cream, what more can I ask for?
If you are not into raw fish, they have a long list of cooked food (in sets) that you can choose from."
ChIJGyYBjxkBBDQR3z4HidEB7Nw,Absolute pleasant experience! My husband and I ordered the lunch omakase and got about 10 different sashimi and sushi each - all super fresh and well prepared. The chef is very attentive and the place is super kids friendly. Highly recommended.
ChIJIasPQe8ABDQR4O2nNJxZyMc,"One of the best Omakase I ever have
Value for money
Chefs and staffs are professional"
ChIJYxeNJegBBDQR4O0ms8wP-rA,"Food was excellent in taste with attention to detail. Even the Bonito Udon had the flavor of mushroom lightly infused into the soup. Highly recommend it together with the grilled crab, pork belly and stuffed chicken wings. The restaurant has a nice setup and makes you feel like you're in Japan and the staff were very proactive. Highly recommend coming to this place."
ChIJwdeF6OsABDQRVlyHAYQQGqA,"A neat Japanese restaurant tucked into the unassuming corner of a kind of ""cul-de-sac""! Lunch sets were quite reasonably priced with fine and fresh ingredients! Just find the way of which they prepare the sushi rice unusal! Overall, a nice and delightful experience!"
ChIJp9vSifIABDQRIiJTiAgzpFY,Liked the environment and food. Sushi was so so but beef udon was super good.
ChIJOfp6GmYBBDQR4tayKeFBUxM,"Little pricey, but worth the penny for the good service and delicious quality food. Recommended for a small group or a date. I came for lunch and enjoyed the sushi lunch box set and a tasty tempura too."
ChIJsdKehOYABDQRDb3o_BLvumI,"Private room can be arranged for group with special arrangements. Excellent food choice, great service!

Recommend for people who prefer privacy."
ChIJo0xr4PIABDQRzRKEv1m4Ww8,"love their lunch sets, and they have very good deluxe set which gets you a chance to try every kinds of food like sashimi, tempura, grilled fish and many others all in one go, their dessert are cute too"
ChIJp_82WAQBBDQRqSgD6-bC7No,"Very nice Japanese restaurant in this area, which is rare. Their eel is fantastic, tried the grilled skewers, very fresh and grilled to perfection. They also have a variety of whole fishes there for sashimi."
ChIJzYzozMYHBDQRC4CLjnlk7I4,"A nice and cozy Japanese restaurant with attentive service. We ordered the seafood teppanyaki set with lobster, cod fish and beef. Not bad overall but hardly impressive. If you are a big fan of teppanyaki you may want to try other dishes (sushi etc) they offer."
ChIJ17MUdnYBBDQRntPOSfMM9Rw,Tried its lunch ser sashimi with rice. The sashimi (salmon) was surprisingly fresh. The size is not very large but they offer rice refill.
ChIJt4lyxrMBBDQR3AwIvNLAiog,5 star on quality and reasonable price. Finally can have more Japanese standard sushi with good pricing.
ChIJ_X7EUWIBBDQRrB9CJvG39oE,"Pretty Nice place to hang out and have quality food
Staff are very supportive and helpful. Great service and able to show us what they have and what they can offer
Quality of food is very good, fresh and nice
Style is also very cool and authentic...
Great for casual dinner with friends and buddy. Nice option of beer and wine and sake. U can sit here till late and enjoy the Harbour and view over eat HK island
Love to come again"
ChIJYeGEE4YBBDQRnKjcRVj4DzY,"Great localized Japanese restaurant. It is a great local option if you are tired of all those Chinese restaurants around the district and wants something new, especially if you are living in that area and wish to patronize a restaurant that is nothing too fancy, reasonably priced and covenient.

The food is definitely not fancy and very localized, but for a restaurant that is actually more of a chaa can ting, Day Sin One Bun is a great option."
ChIJeX_QhzMBBDQRXUBIwR_HoRg,"Delicious Japanese food near Monster Building

The restaurant locates in the “East Pavilion”, which is a newly renovated mall underneath the “Monster Building”. The restaurant is spacious. Sashimi is fresh and tasty. Robatayaki is authentic and juicy. Manager speaks good English. Free WiFi is provided."
ChIJxwRO5AwBBDQRxjG5gkxrsgs,"Fair price with good quality & quantity
I have weird eating habits that I dont like salmon and white/silver fish. The chef sent me the sashimi plate which fully satisfied my eating habits.

Staffs are nice and the chef is cooked with hard. Even the tempura is a bit too thick in deep fried paste but all good taste and fresh."
ChIJL5BfSgwBBDQRNuJO7--eAdc,Pretty good Japanese don. The food is quite fresh.  The vinegar jelly for the rice is quite interesting and tasty.  And the fish soap added to the rice when you almost finished is actually pretty delicious.  Will be back again for other don.
ChIJ529HwToBBDQRSGOusQH1mR0,"Amazing Japanese food with amazing price. Each set includes a main dish, soup, a side dish and a drink. Amazing service from the staffs there too. Strongly recommend."
ChIJUZZmSQwBBDQRabZs8BFXJwA,"Japanese style cafe serves with Hokkaido soup curry. It’s delicious and will come to visit again
"
ChIJAQCwSwwBBDQRNusIebAtifs,"It was an excellent breakfast time at Favilla café, decent little shop with good quality of food and coffee.
Not much choice but the menu is all you need, I had avocado egg salad on toast with Japanese blend coffee, great crispy toast, generous topping, coffee was great too.
Interior is decent and clean, staff are nice, price is reasonable. highly recommended."
ChIJ637sCkABBDQRaUFpiEb74Lo,"I've been here a multiple times prior to the covid-19 outbreak because this place always serves fresh sashimi bowl with a satisfying portion at a reasonable price.

If you are not into raw fish, they have a long list of cooked food (in sets) that you can choose from."
ChIJpe20bgUBBDQRIcxyXHNszz4,"Having a family dinner at this Japanese nearby home, 5 minutes walking distance from North Point MTR. Overall pretty good quality of fish used in sashimi & sushi with a pretty high price tag in this neighborhood. We ordered a extra large plate of sashimi & a extra large plate of sushi. Very fresh fishes but not a lot of varieties, pretty standard selections. Chutoro handroll is good and so does the chutoro, ikura & Uni sushi. Grilled cod fish, mentaiko stuffed chicken wings, and grilled beef tongue are great too. Handmade ice cream as dessert and coconut ice cream is the best."
ChIJYZbI-AQBBDQRCwIEiybPKVM,"Though it was a bit narrow, foods were fresh and assistants were politeful which made it a nice place to dine in. I even called few take away orders.  Will definately come again."
ChIJvyKdLpsBBDQRK4EZsdfDqvE,"Tried this place and every dish is all about eggs!
Apparently the eggs are directly imported from Okinawa.
We were so full after just eating the 5kind Rolled Omelette Skewer!!!
If you love eggs, give it a go ;)"
ChIJ94keTwABBDQRZUUphnCrauQ,"Kane Tsuru is one of the coolest place to go for the chicken soup ramen.  The broth has a rich and creamy texture with the natural sweetness of the chicken which making it so irresistible!

Chicken White Soup Ramen (HK$98)
The wow factor of this bowl of ramen was the broth, the chicken broth was full of rich and milky flavour.  The noodles was cooked to the right firmness that I was looking for, the sliced chicken offered a delicate texture and the fried burdocks were crispy delicious too."
ChIJPW9R51AABDQRgGagHZEYNOs,Great experience; quality fish and service. Amazing lunch deal 12-piece sushi set. Highly recommend! :)
ChIJIybpkVsABDQRpuMrGwj7pKA,"Amazing lunch sets and at affordable price ranges. Chef was friendly and gave us some great laughs. Fresh ingredients served and clean environment, they also provide each diner an innovative mask holder!"
ChIJ9U1p71YABDQRws-jsu7RT0M,Authentic Japanese cuisine with exceptional standard! Worth a revisit. Prior booking is highly recommended
ChIJ46ut2MMBBDQRTxJ5V48bsEg,ordered the 12 sushi deluxe set today. sashimi quality is above standard. value for money. there are only 12 seats so highly recommend to make reservation
ChIJO_FEPhgBBDQRfatryQxDneg,"Friendly owner and staffs!
The food and service were top notch!
Everything was so fresh and well made!
We will return for more next time when we visit Hong Kong again!"
ChIJyZbpnZIBBDQRAuHYFm8wgug,"Loving the experience here! I've tried 10-pieces premium sushi lunch set and it's totally worth it! Fresh and delicate sushi, and the chef also took time to explain dish by dish, taking care of our preference (wasabi / allergy etc). Nice deco and good photogenic setup too! You will get the best experience by sitting at the chef bar table. Definitely will come again!"
ChIJ2Yfh_FMABDQRPDH3zbV0Oc4,One of the best teppanyaki japanese in town. Staff are friendly and accommodating to dietary needs and will recommend dishes as well and flexible ordering.  Will be one of my favourite places to dine
ChIJATfsOFcABDQRK7zfvFfPAAk,It's a historical Japanese restaurant that has stood for many many years. The decor was beautiful and classy. The tables were separated into different compartments that allow privacy. The staffs were attentive. We had their deluxe lunch set for 2 at around $400 for 2 persons. The food were delicious. We enjoyed the grilled black cod especially. The fish was very tender and seasoned beautifully. The price was on the higher end but their lunch sets were certainly worth it.
ChIJH_cV6lYABDQRDqZbOrsuOt4,"very friendly and funny chef who customize our menu upon request.  food was nice, price reasonable, and i will visit again."
ChIJXbzixYkBBDQRgXnBh8Eq07k,"There are so many food you can eat here. The quality of food is okay and the sushi is fresh and good! The waiter responded timely. Overall, good experience for the price!"
ChIJf_IK21YABDQRonuL6hOyFRM,"Koheitsu is a nice and tiny restaurant located in Causeway Bay area, price and quality are reasonable.
Came here for lunch, as it's almost full at 1pm.  It's suggested you book before you come here.
The food here is good, and the size just fit.  You can always refill if you need more rice anyway.
Price here is acceptable and not that expensive"
ChIJ4zmLxe0ABDQReoh5vnsVojc,"Excellent miniature buffet with many choices for everyone! The fish is very fresh, grill foods are good, the rolls are square pieces, the alcohol delicious and in good portion, and everyone gets a Haagen Dazs!"
ChIJIybpkVsABDQRpuMrGwj7pKA,Reservations required. 2 hours time limit.
ChIJK2uAUJUBBDQREJd-99Dg1KI,"Although a bit expensive, but I do enjoy the meal there. The food quality is great, very fresh sashimi. Can feel the heart of chef. On top of it, the service itself is excellent. They help you clean the table all the time. Introduce and explain each dishes. Definitely, worth the money!"
ChIJM6O9TFkABDQRt4yUS8xzYkY,Our favorite Teppanyaki in Hong Kong. Love their roasted garlic and scallion wrapped with quality sliced beef. Absolutely heavenly flavors. Rest of the items on the set menu were also great. Highly recommended!
ChIJj9AhSV0ABDQRWNFfTfVps5Y,"It is the best Japanese restaurant which serve Omakase. The sashimi is very fresh and the price is reasonable.

It is definitely worthy going there if Tokyo is too far away for weekend getaway."
ChIJp4H2WmcABDQRkDoGjC9F-Bg,Ingredients are fresh. Good portion. Nice view. Waitresses may be busy in serving lunch and they are not very tender to customer.
ChIJj7TERF0ABDQRhWPKQ5EOEEU,"Awesome place, can only recommend. Amazing Sake Pairing and food"
ChIJ7Y--AFsABDQRuUdpHqJZRVg,"Love this place.  Foods, services and environment are all very good.

The sashimi was really fresh and delicious; portions were generous as well.  The aji was my favourite, uni was a little below what I expected.

Their ochoko are quite nice too.  However the sakes are a bit expensive."
ChIJ70fWMGYABDQRj6XP4rJ26z4,"High-quality Japanese kaiseki dinner with good service, but no surprise. Restaurant became quite noisy towards later of the night (maybe cos it’s a weekend). Overall an enjoyable night!

My favourite course is the rice dish - the texture is almost like glutinous rice! Really curious of how the chef cooked the rice!"
ChIJA628w34ABDQRzmEiCYLlRyY,"Beautiful dinner experience. The kaiseki is simple and enjoyable yet refined and delicate: a hard balance to strike. Excellent food, great wine & sake list. BRAVO!"
ChIJI27Gx1wABDQRmjekKBa31Dg,We had the set dinner here and chose different dishes and shared. It was all Japanese style home cooking. Price was more than reasonable and taste was excellent.
ChIJ1Z-hFIMBBDQRpOOTDEvNwcY,"This was our first time at the restaurant. We were attracted by the amount of positive reviews in open rice so decided to give it a try. We were greeted with excellent service and also a great recommendation for a sake. We started off with a crispy crab which was very fresh, as well as slices of sashimi. Moving on to the sushi was the best part of the meal, each piece was carefully crafted and the tastes complemented each other very well. We were pleasantly surprised by the amount of guidance and explanation given to us for each dish by the chefs. Overall a great experience that ended with tempura and udon. We left with a very full stomach"
ChIJbe6CrEQABDQRrjOHziNf7XY,A clean calm Japanese Vegetarian restaurant nested right in the middle of Wan Chai. Simple clean wholesale natural Ingredients with good flavours. Of course you must love carbs. It’s was delicious anyways. Lunch menu or tasting menu available.
ChIJUesQJV0ABDQRI-jt-g0e0y4,"A highly reputed Osaka-originated kushikatsu restaurant. Not a big fan of deep fried food, but their choices of ingredients do surprise me and stimulate my taste buds. The dinner tonight is served in special restaurant-week menu. I especially like the starter consisting of the salty jelly, sour cucumber and fried chicken pieces. The ox tongue are thick with texture, which is one of a kind. The meal is wrapped up with a nice yuzu sorbet ice cream, which i can't be more satisfied after finishing this summer dessert."
ChIJv4kEEFsABDQRh2CKMguhS80,Descent little Japanese restaurant serving authentic Japanese food. There's not much room inside but it makes it feel cozy. Service is pretty good. I like it here
ChIJX7XOIl0ABDQRCrjFjyiSKKE,"Seasonal clams ramen $128
Love this new choice of clams with dipping sauce
The sauce is actually not too thick and salty comparing to those you can have elsewhere
It’s very umami with a hint of mushroom, or truffles to be exact
It also comes with an entire spoonful of black truffles paste when served
Very generous portion indeed
Good enough for guys and even to share for ladies
They also have many other varieties of ramen
Personally preferred the spicy one which is a little tilted towards the Chinese style
It’s really suitable for this cold weather"
ChIJZcPgVpwBBDQRadmsyU4cpWY,Authentic japanese food in a tiny joint. Felt like I was transported back to Japan. The buffet is definitely value for money. Reservations highly recommended to prevent disappointment.
ChIJ62KJk3sABDQR2REfztjrxe8,"The return of the Tenkai Omakase dinner menu by Nagasawa san. Authentic while creative tempura pieces. Food is amazing as always, and service is vastly improved"
ChIJ1Za7ImT_AzQRM1aO9s0k5ZM,"Delicious lunch!  It was so much fun sitting at the counter watching the chef prepare the food. All the ingredients were treated with care. They are so thoughtful, the staff prepared a music box playing happy birthday for my husband's birthday!"
ChIJN2YuN3sABDQRGkL1J_ZaQ_I,"Had lunch here twice. Their sushi quality is very good and fresh and the price is reasonable.  I love sitting at the sushi bar so that the chef can tell me what kind of fish I am having, will sure return often."
ChIJwz6v0GQABDQRDHeWyLZ3i7g,"The thing i love about Japanese food is the intent that goes into everything that's made and presented.
This Michelin star restaurant takes that to another level and offers a subtle experience with every course.
Whilst the menu is not cheap, it is well worth it on a special occasion."
ChIJZfURlHsABDQR9VBgpKerMxc,This is a specialized restaurant which serves only tempura. Their lunch menu has just two choices: an 8-pieces set and an omakase set. The tempura is prepared in front of you by a Japanese chef over a bar table. Service is very attentive and food is very scrumptious - making it easily the best tempura restaurant in Hong Kong.
ChIJ154f5NcBBDQR8yMiyA3ZSM0,"Super fresh ingredients and a great chef! I especially loved the uni that just melts in your mouth in a creamy, delicious burst of flavour!

All the dishes were incredibly well seasoned with just the right amount of sauce/wasabi, really impressed!"
ChIJZRpAHOoBBDQR5w6pq-8DPY4,"Great japanese omakase with very good decorative setup
Ingredient is fresh and good. And the service is perfect.
Slightly expensive but worth the price. One tip is to request for bar table when you reserve so you can watch the chef work on your good. Highly recommended"
ChIJB3KdJm0BBDQRnT30AVXbZdA,"Amazing Sushi Lunch. Very value for money and uses the top notch ingredients. Small place but extremely detail oriented as you can see the plates, decor and even the toothpick very well thought out. Highly recommended but hard to book as it only sits 8. Would say just as good or even better than other top notch joint in Hong Kong."
ChIJndMII3wABDQRKoodU-63ikQ,"It is a cozy sushi shop near the sheung wan indoor market. I went here at lunch hours and there were a number of people waiting outside. It did not taking reservations at lunch so had to wait a bit. The lunch menu was visible at the store front so could read through it and killed some time. We were let in after just 15 minutes wait. We had the deluxe sushi rice bowl but it first came with the salad, udon and steamed egg. The sushi rice bowl was huge and nice for photo taking! There were a lot of fish, different kinds, on the top and prawns too. The rice could hardly be seen cause there were too much fish on the top! Very fresh they were. The set was huge and definitely enough for 2 people, i guess it’s too much for 2 girls tho! Very good price for such proportion and quality! Good service too!"
ChIJL5BfSgwBBDQRNuJO7--eAdc,"Very authentic and special sushi experience at Umi! All food coming fresh and unique, chef Kimijima-San is very humble and nice
Definitely one of the best in town"
ChIJjfnDs4b_AzQRv5VixxX2XGE,"best omakase, best staff, best alfresco, best price. wish i could give 10 stars!"
ChIJF7dmpZD_AzQRcvIVjEQyRck,"This is one of my lovest Japanese restaurant in Hong Kong. I come to have lunch usually because the price is more reasonable.

The suishi of this restaurant is wonderful. The chef use the different ingredient to let you have the best experience to each sushi.

If you love sushi, this is a must-try restaurant."
ChIJOQr0n4D_AzQRKUpvxViHBcc,"Yummy Omakase, friendly helpful staff and chef. A cozy little restaurant. Just the sliding door open with weird noise."
ChIJ70fWMGYABDQRj6XP4rJ26z4,"High-quality Japanese kaiseki dinner with good service, but no surprise. Restaurant became quite noisy towards later of the night (maybe cos it’s a weekend). Overall an enjoyable night!

My favourite course is the rice dish - the texture is almost like glutinous rice! Really curious of how the chef cooked the rice!"
ChIJ56EuzID_AzQRv3vZo5ofcho,"Fantastic place for Taiwanese street fare. Prices, though several times higher than what you'd pay in Taipei, are still quite reasonable. The Taiwanese staff are justifiably proud of the restaurant's offerings. The new Kennedy Town location is much larger than the previous Sai Ying Pun location, though I suspect customers have to queue up at busy times. The drinks and snacks are both spot on."
ChIJbU5b5YH_AzQRqNtolh0uPwQ,"Nice Taiwanese hotpot place. Nice broth, I recommend their Chinese herbal broth. Good quality meat. Also, they have a wide selection of fresh vegetables which you can seldom find in other hotpot places."
ChIJhbLxqToCBDQReB-VJRFtiA4,"The pig hand has a layer of intestines and intestines, and the pig's hand is softly drenched. The layer of intestine is a powdered intestine. The taste is bitter and bitter, the intestines are sweet and delicious, the rice noodles are completely simmered in the soup, the food is made with heart, and the pearl milk tea is rich in pearls. ! I can't estimate that there is a good food in Xiaoxiwan!"
ChIJ-0FjqHQBBDQRdtijS1_g7Pc,"Inside a big n bustling shopping centre. Authentic Taiwanese food. Price not inexpensive and portion is big. This shop seems recently renovated n seats r comfortable. Nice for friends reunion,  couples n family."
ChIJw_OTgCf7AzQREPRt1k8-nFY,"Food portions were so big with that price. Service was super quick. The taste wasn't authentic compared to real taiwanese food but as a Hong Konger, I kinda liked it. Will definitely revisit in the future."
ChIJebDixVEBBDQR-8IsHmFfPSU,"Yuan Is Here is a nice Taiwanese restaurant, the interior makes it feel like local street food in Taiwan and the food tastes amazing. The braised beef bowl rice is highly recommended and it will not disappoint! The staff are friendly and it’s a overall nice atmosphere to dine in."
ChIJf0uwkkUBBDQRuqaqdxIHvSA,Great take away option in the area. Dinner combo is good value. Crispy chicken leg. Big portion for rice.
ChIJc2w-5MoBBDQRAwF8MmBPYYQ,"Delicious and authentic Taiwanese food but slightly overpriced considering where it is located and decoration.

We tried the beef noodle with different types of meet balls and the stewed pork rice for main and fried chicken snack as starter. All are qualify made with fresh ingredients and in good portion."
ChIJ8fMYHUUBBDQRitCeRs15AnI,gorgeous and thoughtful decorations with very friendly staff. Food is delicious and in good layout as well.
ChIJ50XpHPIDBDQR6A8IXB2CzDM,Great Taiwanese food. Their portions were fairly generous. We had the pork rice with deep fried chicken and cold sesame sauce noodles with chicken which both taste amazing. Price was reasonable as well!
ChIJSVuU7GkDBDQRxSvv4SC65pM,"Very nice noodles, and dumplings. Get the sets together with a drink, but the portions could have been bigger."
ChIJw6-zoOUDBDQR3dk94w_TlmU,"restaurant inside Park Central, Tsueng Kwan O above McDonald's.

The fried chicken was tasty and non-greasy and the chicken wings were cooked properly. The wonton could have done with a little more cook time but overall, this was an excellent choice and return is likely. The service was quick despite it being busy.

Five dishes came to HK$265. There's a discount if you pay by certain credit cards, and there are cash and ecash options."
ChIJk3eHUA4FBDQRduTQXv0hq5g,"麻辣紅燒牛肉麵
Tasty but the service is sub-par. You feel like an item on the conveyor belt being rushed the moment you walk in."
ChIJqahXcFsABDQRnTJsSdnp6Qk,Good food and reasonable price. They made Very delicious roasted beef!! The oyster congee from their all Day menu is also very nice ! I love the service they provided. Feels like home. Thank you for giving us tofu dessert 
ChIJRVhFtF0BBDQRVQ7OMYYINT8,"Tasty Taiwanese cuisine that comes at a cost. The Dan Zai noodles and grilled pepper pork were both delicious. The pepper pork was very tender and juicy. The smokiness, saltiness from the pork and sourness from the vinegar and saltiness were well balanced. However, the portions were relatively small."
ChIJf_R1DVsABDQRb6Kyjx1pj1Q,"you like in 1950s old village (老眷村).

The food is good, but not that amazing as its decoration (at the standard of evaluating Taiwanese food as a Taiwanese, so a bit strict here).

The Green Papaya Pork Ribs Soup is very good, like homemade type. 炒水蓮 is also good. Personally like their Lemon Aiyu Jelly (檸檬愛玉) very much!

Their 老皮嫩肉(Fired Tofu) is actually just 炸豆腐, instead of typical 老皮嫩肉. The color should be brown, but not gold. Don’t know how to cook, but maybe more sauce (?)

Overall it’s good, and the environment is comfortable and spacious, and the staff is very nice!"
ChIJ__-_EVQABDQR7rTtQj1dhiY,"Delicious soup dumplings and other little side dishes. The restaurant is big and sometimes crowded but the queue goes fast as the restaurant is well organized. Pretty much everything here is good. Xiao Long bao, shumai, veggies, Dan Dan noodles, wontons, red bean buns. They were out of some items when we visited, such as the pork buns but that didn’t take away from our experience at all."
ChIJj9xWOlQABDQRfStnuTghUJM,"Decent lunch place within the $50 - $70 range. Rice and noodles available, and the typical taiwanese drinks."
ChIJxbEvUlcABDQR2PC3ptvVxIg,"I came here at the behest of a friend with no expectations. Must say I'm impressed. The beef and tendon are tender, the broth - we ordered the beef and tendon noodles with original broth - was rich and we didn't taste the MSG. Quick and prompt service. Would come back here again if I have a hankering for good bowl of beef noodles."
ChIJGZl74VYABDQRaDq3HwF1bYk,"Great value tea time menu with a wide selection of Taiwanese dishes such as rice, noodle, pancake rolls and snacks. Tasty milk tea and can choose little sugar and little milk.  The restaurant is very clean and service is good."
ChIJ9b9IByIBBDQRQ63Qi_-NrPk,Tasty and well executed food at reasonable prices. Place is small but well decorated. Great pick.
ChIJORCPtQIBBDQR2-skpp6zgOs,loved the fried pork tenderloin here. it's HUGE. I had the honey yuzu glazed one and it was refreshing on a hot day. can't finish the whole bowl because of the large portion. it's pretty packed in lunch hours so you'd probably have to wait for awhile but that's worth it! I'll try their classic next time!
ChIJh-RAmlYABDQRDM5raYsa1KY,"Yiya Taiwanese restaurant located on the 5th floor of Island Beverley, although they have a nice window seat, but the food just average.
Came here and tried their crisp chicken noodles and bubble tea. The noodle is average, and the crisp chicken is very hard, not likely is fresh fried.
The milk tea is OK, but the bubble in the tea is hard to chew.
However, they have a nice window surrounding the restaurant, and its comfortable where there with sunlight, and also a good view of busy Causeway Bay crossing"
ChIJaQPhNlQABDQRqsiBjgOlm2c,"Conveniently located inside Windsor house, a 7 to 10min walk from Causeway Bay MTR station.  There is an Ikea, Decathlon, Victoria park for outdoor activities, Don Don Donki (popular Japanese store) within 5min walk.  The setting is nice and cozy.  Window seats have the Victoria park view.  Food are surprisingly tasty and affordable given my first impression of the restaurant is for high school and college students.  Each dish is well presented with a tinge of ""kawaii-ness"".  Overall, it's a nice little place to enjoy your lunch and dinner."
ChIJ9TDBGgABBDQRSpAalo0NKAY,"The interior is decorated with dark wood and  gives of the rustic authentic Taiwanese feeling. We went during lunch rush hour and noticed near the end of the meal the staff were quite unorganised and impolite.
The lunch menu with rice is a steal for its price. The highlight was the fried chicken, which was hot and crispy when it came. The rice and minced pork itself was quite dry tbh. My friend had the noodles and the beef was super tender and flavourful. The only criticism would be that the ratio of pickle to meat was slightly off. We would be like more of the pickled veg. Overall a good satisfying meal."
ChIJ8x2olAMBBDQRSOuxX_3lw6k,"A shop located on a quite street. I went there in evening but wasn’t too many people. I came here to try its signature grilled goose and it really worths the fame!!!!! Crispy skin, tender and juicy meat, very strong the goose grease taste best to eat with rice or noodles! And it is very reasonably priced! I knew the bbq pork is also good but we could not eat too much at one time lol. Cause this time we also ordered the spicy chicken, a baby pigeon, fried rice noodles with beef and a vege. Omg they were all so nice. After the meal they offered free sweet soup, it was green beans sweet soup tonight. Very good little Chinese restaurant. Knowing from the posters that this small shop always helps the community by offering free meals to the elderly or people in need, and other community works. Happy to see this. Support and respect!!"
ChIJI3CxzQ0BBDQR62F2P8tQxtk,"Very nice place with Taiwanese styled foods. Variety of foods and drinks could be chosen such as beef noodles, braised minced pork rice, snacks. Really delicious and taste really great with large portion. Reasonable prices! Good environment with nice service!"
ChIJzT8Il50BBDQRwu4U5_1_StU,Reasonably priced food with good quality. Polite and nice waiters. Not very crowded and quite hygienic. Recommended
ChIJEzXdVFUABDQRrCHQf6sRtnk,"Michelin-recognised since 2012, this beef brisket noodle shop is one of the best in HK. The clear beef broth is tasty and the beef brisket melts in your mouth. Other signature dishes include beef tendon, wanton and fish balls. There is a choice of wide or thin egg noodles (al dente texture) or the traditional flat rice noodles. Also, try some curry sauce with your noodles or a bowl of stewed radish. You won’t be disappointed!"
ChIJLXGDJVD7AzQRYtJfyMuv0Vg,I decided to have a lunch there after I took a look at the menu in front of the entrance. However I was a bit disappointed when my order came - Fried pork with minced pork sauce rice (HKD39). And I I could just taste the fried pork bones instead of meat. Seems there was also too much ice in my glass of iced lemon tea.
ChIJISAIbD37AzQRxNhQXMEE-bA,"Inside a big n bustling shopping centre. Authentic Taiwanese food. Price not inexpensive and portion is big. This shop seems recently renovated n seats r comfortable. Nice for friends reunion,  couples n family."
ChIJP-bloQr6AzQRc_WazCo5718,"Decent food with the choice to pick two separate dish in one. So very good to try two things for the price of one. Someone said it's overpriced. I guess normally HK$70 per person is enough, tea set is cheaper but not a great selection so normally I order off the main menu.

The male staff there are very nice and always respectful. The seating is good, you can sit for long time without being kicked out, asked to change table, etc. They also have booths to sit in.  Most restaurants are very tight space so this place is nice for its comfortable seating."
ChIJReytdaDwAzQRovoNDSw_74U,Pretty close to the authentic Taiwan taste.  Fried Chicken and roast chicken are the recommended dishes.  Golden chicken leg is uncut to preserve the juice.
ChIJWUY20YfwAzQRa4UerULyshk,Nice one. It probably will be the only high quality hot spot choice in Tin Shui Wai. Their food are in good quality and their drinks are also good. Staff are helpful and polite. Price are affordable. The environment is clean and polite.  Will be suitable for locals and tourists to have a heavy dinner here.
ChIJq6rHSmLwAzQRUaaXg3HRCXg,"taiwan cuisine restaurant. specially interior design with taiwan style. taiwan milk tea , desert, noodle are served. staff is nice. fruit salad is delicious."
ChIJN2OsHXHxAzQRZPrYikULD9o,Great! Can't imagine that there has such a good restaurant in industrial centre. Staff are nice. Tried several dishes and all are delicious!
ChIJK78C4KDwAzQRxX4EBCkpr2g,"Good for trendy youngsters, good Taiwanise style food of moderate price."
ChIJw-Ju_An6AzQR5eARdi4fPZU,"Yuen Long is a chicken farm. There are two high-quality Taiwanese restaurants. I want to make a meal at the restaurant tonight. I will go to the left-handed roof to buy a take-away. Do take-away, the two seats outside the scene, should be squatting

Menu is very simple, use the wooden sign to hang the left outside, get 10 嘢 around, pick up the meat and rice cooker,  meat rice, meat, Zhong Youqu new products salt crisp chicken 
Waiting for the left 10 minutes to stand up and sell it home, the traditional desktop round take-out pocket (Hong Kong most use box) open a lunch box, simmered rice with tofu, fat, coriander, rice, rice, pearl rice Soak the simmering juice, and then fish all the food, there is a table of salt, salty and salty, both magical"
ChIJtZsfbA35AzQRnH5CD7uNgHI,"The place is simple and bright. The medicated pork ribs soup is full of ingredients, but the soup base is light. Brine chicken has bones, eat meat. Eating makes you feel happy in Taiwan."
ChIJhfBdkfH4AzQROtHXJN9fz64,"The literal translation of the name of Cha Fan is 3 tea 6 rice. It served good Taiwanese food and of reasonable price. The wall art resembled the logo of the popular bubble tea house Hey Tea.

I always ordered their deep fried chicken set, which tasted especially good with the hot black (red) tea in the set."
ChIJ__-_3wn6AzQRKw7KdHvdBY0,Great braised pork noodle & rice! Interesting soup as well. Quite different to other versions commonly on offer in HK.
ChIJVyhKNqb5AzQROJpj_fJ96Sk,"Today, I plan to walk the Yuen Tsuen Ancient Road from Tsuen Wan Adventist Hospital to Sham Tseng. Of course, I have to fill my stomach before setting off. Among the multinational cuisines, Taiwan is my favorite, because most of them are suitable for Asian tastes, especially Hong Kong people. I saw on the Internet that Taiwan Guojianglong Beef Noodles has opened a branch in Hong Kong. As a loyal eater of beef noodles, of course you can't miss it.

Location: In one of the large shopping malls in Tsuen Wan, near the West Rail Station, it is very convenient, but the entrance is obscured by the central column. People who are not familiar with the shopping environment may miss it. But there were always people queuing outside the door, and we were no exception. It took about 15 minutes.

Environment: The exterior is a glass wall, direct sunlight or light from the shopping mall, it looks bright and natural. At the entrance are the bar and cash register. The wall in the middle has its signboard and wooden doors and windows. The tables and chairs used by the guests are also wooden. Even the partitions match the restaurant design.

Afternoon:
Signature Braised Tendon Beef Noodles (with handmade noodles) $80+ longan honey ginger tea $28 (frozen)
The first is that the color of the soup base is dark brown, smells strong, and tastes of Chinese medicine, but it is not strong and acceptable. The beef tendon heart cut to a thick body is marinated soft, the fat is pattern-like and the meat is mellow, it is completely tough and has a sauce-flavored taste, and the meat is stronger than the beef zhan. The handmade noodles are tough and strong in soup. I personally like handmade noodles more than young ones. The ginger mother tea will not be too sweet, because the ice will dilute, and the ginger will not be spicy, just right.

Spicy Garlic Flavored Tendon, Half Tendon, Half Meat Noodles ($84) + Winter Melon, Barley and Lemon Special Drink $30 (Frozen)
This was ordered by a friend because she likes spicy, and although this noodle is spicy, it will not be so spicy or dry, but it will become more and more spicy. This beef tendon has more tendons and more chews, but I would choose more signature than this one.

It is worth mentioning that each bowl of noodles is accompanied by a small plate of sauerkraut. The taste is very appetizing, and my friends and I find it delicious.

Salted Chicken $48
This snack loses its color, because the fried noodles are thick and the flesh is drier. Although the fried fragrant is crispy and the portion is large, the taste is average. On the contrary, there are fried perilla leaves underneath, which is very fragrant. I should have the brine platter next time."
ChIJQzDPU-z4AzQRHR_oCALEtN0,"Beef and broth are not bad. The place is spacious with a good variety of food.
Unlike those in Taipei, there is no fruits, draft beer and wine. However, there are still dessert."
ChIJ7_PSr_IBBDQRso78Na5Wx2g,"Came here for dinner. The dinner Bubble tea options in the main dining area are limited to 5 teas only. The wintermelon tea with Sichuan spicy pearls was interesting in a good way.

The uni truffle chicken was amazing ($188) but the Kiki noodles were disappointing. Very few vegetable options. Would recommend the steamed rice rolls.

Food comes out incredibly quickly (too quickly) as all food ordered came within 10 minutes of ordering."
ChIJTyHvUV0ABDQR8iV1O84tieo,"The shrimp noodle soup is super good. It almost taste like lobster soup. The noodle can be better, it was abit too soft for me. Pricy!"
ChIJJZGYaj37AzQR0dH_y_1WoF8,Very memorable dinner with family of excellent Korean BBQ dishes.. 
ChIJTT-GyWwBBDQRRTVgtU07sGY,"A good place for gathering and dating.
Spacious enough and comfy lighting. Their menu is surprisingly affordable considering their decor and food quality. Their meat offers didn't warrant five stars (no noticeable herbs) but their overall dish choices are genius. For two, you can order two sets of meat if both of you are carnivores. Or order one set of meat plus few side dishes like big mushroom with onion and cheese, and the Korean fried chicken paired with chili and sour sauce.
The self-service bar would also be a draw to many. Though not many choices, free flow of soft drinks, coffee and tea, salad, soup and popcorn.
The only thing that disappoints is their choice of ice cream. I wouldn't mention the local brand but it's just ice and no cream with a little artificial flavors."
ChIJ9ysiIMcABDQRXVulXrh0fRc,"A nice Korean Restaurant!
Huge variety of food! We really love the combo which allows you to choose what you want! The fries are really hot and crispy also.
The Korean dessert is a must-try. Love the ice dessert which is so refreshing!
Will definitely come back again ^^"
ChIJrVZ-JVEABDQRKhxmLGgrF8U,"Delicious fried chicken! We ordered the crunchy one, the seasoning is on point!
The egg with the cheese is also pretty good. The egg is nice and fluffy."
ChIJF52kku4ABDQRIJ-_wEGMLhI,"Second visit in two months time. Tried their fried squid, seafood veg pancake and cheesy pork belly this time. Generous portion and very delicious overall. Must-try Korean restaurant in TST."
ChIJzR5W51AABDQRzhFPohJkqa4,"One of the best Korean cuisine restaurant in Causeway Bay.
Fried chicken comes with tons of different flavor from hot spicy to honey sweet taste or just any Korean dishes. You can find something you’d love to try in their menu.
However might not be a best place to chit chat with your accompanies. Small place with tables set very closed to each other force you to speak louder in order to hear people sitting opposite to you, or you do this just to cover the voice over the next table."
ChIJyeh94VYABDQRFkcFJYY5Cks,"Great Korean restaurant within affordable price. This was my second time here after 2 years, and surprisingly the quality is still maintained. Recommend to those who have a limited budget but are still craving for some fried chicken and deukbogi with soju on a Friday night!"
ChIJ4exW51AABDQRqWtvRwN-lQM,"This place was on the 22nd floor and a nice little escape. The food is wonderful and even though I forgot to take pics, I can vouch for the pumpkin croquettes, soft bone chicken dumplings and the pork and chicken rice pots. A superbly cheap and tasty meal."
ChIJJ37AzFAABDQRwGbTQeI5u_U,Goobne is very famous oven chicken brand in Korea. The chicken is really crispy and tender. The sauce base on Korean recipe is good with their oven chicken. Central shop is located near Lan Kwai Fong. I'm sure it's good place for lunch and dinner both.
ChIJDdg676UBBDQRU3mViQMqRm4,"This Korean eatery provides vegetarian options.  The food tasted good and was served a fair portion at a fair price.  The foods were ready and packed.  People can simply pick the foods and pay.  There are limited single seats in the shop.  People can use the common seating area instead.  However, there are always crowded during lunch hours.  It is not easy to find a vacant chair as no one managed the seating area, people can occupy the chairs for long time.  There is outdoor seating area but also fully occupied."
ChIJiW0qg3sABDQRtRkVmaRMS9g,"Keep coming back for the chicken banh mi! The chicken perfectly cooked and crispy, so tasty!!"
ChIJIzRRTlcABDQRpNKsmDm7yAI,"I have been twice and enjoyed it very much! The chicken is just perfect without too much grease or batter. It is definitely bar with bar food around dinner time, but chill and not over crowded.

We also enjoyed the 치즈 해물 떡볶이 (seafood with rice cakes in hot sauce gratiné). It was spicy, but exactly as it should be."
ChIJAQBEfFkABDQRTiTitYItUfU,"This place can be found on the podium (2nd level) nearest to the main road.

The atmosphere was pleasant and the happy hour drink selection was decent.

The food was delicious and very scrumptious. I particularly liked the fried chicken and the beef short ribs."
ChIJDQbuzlAABDQRyvG28RjiMDo,"One of the best korean/bbq places in wan chai/causeway. Been here 15+ times and each time fulfilled. Service is top notch even during busy times. Menu prices is above average, but portions are very large so it’s worth it."
ChIJkV0wMnsABDQRIQ6GKDf7yT0,Tasty and not oily Korean fried chicken!  Nice and cheerful staff!
ChIJZ9JAkHsABDQReuGYhZB9j2s,"Moyo is a modern Korean restaurant located on Aberdeen Street just across from PMQ in the Sheung Wan/Central area of Hong Kong Island. They hare a small interior seating area and offer take-away and delivery for those who prefer to take meals at area offices, homes and hotels. Opening hours are 12pm - 3pm (lunch) and 6pm - Midnight (dinner) daily, closed on Sundays.

They offer an expected range of Korean dishes at prices you expect to find in this area of the city. We recently ordered in from Moyo, food was delivered in around 25 minutes and everything tasted pretty good. The bibimbap was a nice mix of ingredients and barchan to perk up the flavours a bit. Not my favourite bibimbap in the city but better than average and worth ordering again.

We also tried their Korean style spicy fried chicken that was really good. This was a fair-sized portion of boneless chicken fried very well to give it a bit of crisp. Also well marinated with the slightly sweet and spicy flavours, the chicken bites were very nice, something we'd happily reorder.

Overall, our recent meal from Moyo was very good and worth repeating in the future."
ChIJr6JsUHwABDQRLOtXkvcKFcw,"Tried the tofu soup and the kimchi with pork stew, nice authentic flavors. Lunch set range from $62 - $68, a place for quick meal and not suitable for long chats"
ChIJm2vL2lAABDQRG_0RxSirXXw,We’ve come here for both the evening barbecue sets and lunch specials. They’re both decent. A bit pricey (esp the kbbq) but the meat tastes good. The lunch specials were slightly disappointing. We got the soups/stews and they didn’t taste anything like the original Korean dishes they were supposed to be. The servers are usually attentive though they might seat you in a remote section and equip you with a bell (which is fine). This place is good if you need a local Korean fix but don’t expect amazing Korean cuisine (go to Kimberley Road for that).
ChIJpatcxlsABDQRk4gDarsoBAg,A homey place serving good food. Particularly recommended for those looking for hearty and warm meals. The portion is huge here so no need to worry about leaving the restaurant feeling unsatisfied. The side dishes are also amazing!
ChIJWxl5xB8BBDQRIqbV5q6CKUg,"We were lucky to book a table for dinner at the last minute, and weren’t disappointed. I see this restaurant as casual fine dining. The venue and atmosphere is modern and relaxing. The food is nicely presented and pack full of flavour. Service was attentive. It brought back fond memories of the restaurants we visited in Seoul. It is still at its soft opening. I’m sure it will get even better."
ChIJc310U5oBBDQRL7wdxH9EFCA,"nice lunch menu. recommend grilled beef set and tofu seafood soup set.

want to try afternoon tea menu after 2:30 next time"
ChIJl98tH-_LsGoR_xN8ThrBHpE,"I like this place! We come here every other week. Service is kind of typical for Hong Kong. Fast, affordable and tasty. Hot stone bowl for $70"
ChIJcSdsLO4BBDQRfqARNotyjCI,"Tofu seafood hot soup was full with seafood 2 medium shrimps 2 mussels n 2 shell fishes big piece of tofu with one egg. Tasty n spicy, all just right. Leaving table before 12:30 pm got 30%. Take away got 20% off."
ChIJ7fEBBHsABDQRYXMXJwQdbI0,"very good korean food , love the pickle and veggie pancake and rice. healthy food restaurant"
ChIJHaLiSQwBBDQRuwpJku4D9wA,It was cold n needed hot soup. This is the place to go. The seafood tofu soup was very nice not too spicy but flavoured. However only one shrimp and one mussel and some dried octopus meat. A small bowl of rice wasn’t enough to go with. I heard the male client next table who had the same dish asked for more rice. I eventually ordered for one kimbap. It went well overall. Not to mentioned some 3 mini appetisers included. Total was HK$105.
ChIJYQrLEWMABDQRjOmwQQ1OTFc,Decent bibimbap
ChIJQ7LilnsABDQRKmN4p0EqXgo,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in HK. I’m Korean and I assure you that they serve authentic, great quality Korean food. The atmosphere is like genuine Korean pub, I enjoy eating and drinking here with my friends. They serve one of the best Buchu-geon(green onion pancake) and sweet and sour fried chicken I had in my life- seriously better than most of Korean restaurants in Seoul. Love their Naeg-myun(cold noodle) as well. The staff are sweet and kind, I’ve been enjoying their service whenever I visit there. If you feel like drinking, Korean rice drink(Makgeolly) is great- they serve in a bowl as any true Korean restaurant should!"
ChIJl8PscQwBBDQR-qQaIL5DUKc,"I LOVE Babiya. A tiny little hole-in-the-wall owned and run by a lovely Korean family, the food is authentic and delicious. Most times I get the B1 with a soft-fried egg, which is spicy pork and rice with shredded carrots, bean sprouts and a sprinkle of sesame seeds (I'm a creature of habit), but I've tried a few of their other dishes and never found anything I didn't like."
ChIJMT1Eg3ABBDQRERgaUbQQ7MY,"Great portion size (perhaps too much for a girl) but value for the price ordered through deliveroo. Love the tenderness of the chicken and the slightly sweetened sauce. The rest of the sides are good but quite pale in flavours. I was also expecting the egg roll and roast eggplant shown on the menu photos, but still quite a good deal for Korean around central"
ChIJP8-Nn08BBDQRNoMCpzVTO6w,"The cheesy dish is so satisfying that it is a must order if you love cheese. The stone pot one is okay, with enough portion and ingredients. Slightly slightly overpriced I would say. If there's no 10% service charge, I will for sure come again."
ChIJ84aFzYD_AzQRH_IEcdAKy5g,"This coffee shop is renowned in this city. It is because of the high quality of the food and drink. Unlike other coffee shops, this shop has a variety of choices in food and drinks. It is a combination of Japanese food, Korean food, Italian food and also fusion cuisine. The signatures dishes are Cloud Meringue Eel Rice/ Volcano  Meringue Eel and Butggot (Sakura) Shrimp Rice. Both of them really look beautiful, good taste and strong fragrance. Recommend for people who want to taste a fresh&new thing."
ChIJ1wXyh-gtYjUR-Zdo4gjrijg,Went there for lunch. 1.5 hrs all you can eat is a bit rush but the price is very reasonable and most of the food are good. Kimchi soup and seaweed soup are very yummy!!
ChIJMcE3E8gABDQRW-GNMc3LepI,"The ingredients are fresh, the side dishes are delicious, and the price is high. It is recommended that the cow's five-flowered glutinous rice is not greasy and the lettuce is first-class. Chicken, lamb, and squid are delicious. It is worth a visit."
ChIJew9ok1Xe6jkRQwybBzHBltY,"This place is a gem! We are exceptionally picky when it comes to Korean food and this exceeded our expectations.

Small restaurant with only about 20 seats so be prepared to wait. Pretty small menu that specialises in stone bowl bibimpap and also stews.

We tried the Ginseng Chicken Soup and the Gomjatang (Spicy Pork with Potato soup) and they were both amazing! One of the best ginseng chicken soup we’ve had outside of Korea - the soup is creamy and rich but on the saltier side. The meat for both soup was really tender we ate most of the bones along with the meat. It’s hard to come by good ginseng chicken soup so we’ll be back for more.

The stews do not come with rice so you’ll have to top up for rice ($15) or noodles ($20). The noodle portion was small so I would recommend to go for the rice if you’re a big eater.

No water was offered so bring your own if you don’t wish to buy from them! Total Bill for us came up to $400 so definitely not cheap but worth a try."
ChIJBcpPE8gABDQRkSqCWu3DrhM,First time to try bongchu jjimdak in Hong kong. Same taste with Korea bongchu. Good and delicious 
ChIJhRoiyO4ABDQRHNJX0kugMQw,"Had to queue for a while to get in, but it was worth. The meet and vegetables were good. Don't forget to ask for salt and pepper. The beef is a bit pricey, but other meat is okay. Staff will help you with the bbq is you want."
ChIJu5NqVqkBBDQRxB6FUyl5bkM,"The food are yummy. We ordered vege risotto, pumpkin risotto, chicken, Hawaii pizza, Salmon pizza, pasta. now has a promotion of buy 4 get 1 free (means 5 dishes). Not too much people on weekdays lunch. We five girls and the portion is right (a bit too much but ok)."
ChIJ8zuN-K0BBDQR8_nxosRZtCk,"Can't believe this place in Mong kok has such a  nice place for Korean food! The restaurant is well designed with different lab elements and it's so spacious. The main point is even they serve Korean barbecue food here, but you won't get the food smell with you, nice! We order the barbecue beef, it's tender and it's nicely marinated. Fried noodles is not too oily yet tasty. Another cold noodle is with a light taste but adding the korean spicy sauce will just let the magic works! Ordered another cheese pizza, it's filled with thick cheese, very yummy! At last the served the grilled pineapple for free! Very nice !!!"
ChIJy8f-b8YABDQRIgXl9txAcKs,"Huge portion for sharing
Ordered some sides as well, also very delicious
Love the kim chi pizza"
ChIJC0mvm8cABDQRnrOVZiW2a_4,"Absolutely impressed by their food choices and quality. Great place to have dinner at with a group of friends and you'll still have plenty left to eat without being charged too much.

If you're like me looking for fried chicken that doesn't look like it was drowning in oil for days, this is definitely the place to be.  5/5 for that cheese flavoured one"
ChIJjabY4VYABDQRvL5FGgpL5OU,Very tasty. Kimchi is very fresh so as all other appetizers. Lots of variety wit drinks. Good service too.
ChIJQV1HmlYABDQRYBklaXvs5uc,"Nice little dishes to start. The beef bibimbap is nice. You get a little ice cream for dessert. Overall, the lunch is well worth the money. It's always quiet when i go, which i like too."
ChIJzyGmqU0BBDQRt-spjw0WPsM,Nice restaurant.  Wonderful kimchi and BBQ beef!
ChIJZycl2t8ABDQRy48MA2gChN0,"An excellent array of food, including the self-service buffet section. The selection of drinks was fantastic too."
ChIJR3nyJ_QBBDQR-mNv9vXoFw4,It was so much fun to prepare the beef by myself! Enjoy the lunch much.
ChIJbbYql-4ABDQRZ60bNqnpGOs,"Good and very fresh food, especially the sea food. The service is also not bad."
ChIJqWFqQEwBBDQRyw8ZBdfx_Bk,Outstanding fried chicken. Interesting menu of kimchi carbonara pasta and pizza. Great service and nice decor.
ChIJcceA0w4EBDQR9afX1bvDoVM,"Great efficiency, especially when you order your meats; it comes out with not much delay. The raw meats even comes out on a rail if you order 5 or less. As soon as you empty one of the raw meat trays, someone comes and pick it up. Will recommend to others and bring friends"
ChIJx-ejJNsGBDQRdgczYdKzW6Q,"I suppose to come for dinner but arrived early enough that it’s still the tea (or lunch?) menu. Great deal just $138 there’s a beef platter, unlimited rice, a drink and a ring of egg on the side of the grill; and of course the Koran traditional appetizers. The menu has a lot more choices than that, noodles, rice cakes etc. all are the famous yummy Korean food. The beef was ok in quality; i love the egg cause it’s served with cheese and corns that you could choose to add with it. There’s a lot of food so it’s a really great deal, but I’m not sure what’s the cut off time of this set menu. The captain of American(?) or Korea at the entrance is eye catching, great for photo taking!"
ChIJExbxie34AzQRz9tv2YBx_0o,"Tasty Korean food in a convenient and pedestrian-friendly area of Tsuen Wan. This place, called Korean Loft Cafe, has a great tea set pricing, and their sets run until 6pm on weekdays. There are vegetarian options available, too. I would would come back here if I was in the area."
ChIJyzugVcYABDQRmL9FPe73u1M,I visited this Korean restaurant during my visit to Hong Kong last month.  It is located in the ladies market in Mong Kok.  The food here is very yummy and the staffs are very nice.  I like especially the kimchi tofu soup which is spicy and super delicious.   The Kimchi pancake and Kimchi dumplings are very good choice too! This restaruants serves Korean beer and Soju which is a good match with the kimchi dishes here!
ChIJWS2n21AABDQRcH9_j1J3DsA,"Serve with heart & delicious for a reasonable price! Yummy of the signature dish, beef source rice wrapped with creamy egg!"
ChIJhwPnZfIABDQRUYUlAwQNVeE,"The best service, chicken and soup I have had in a long time. heavily suggest to all Americans to come here when in hong kong."
ChIJFfYhyO4ABDQRbC1DeYIUsQI,Delicious ribs and fried chicken.
ChIJGwatKe4HBDQRdSQSDTlH6Iw,Delicious piping hot egg sandwiches. Worth the short wait.
ChIJJfnZZfIABDQRTekx7sqVyHs,"Excellent service, delicious food, quiet environment, reasonable price, Bak Kut Teh is delicious and sweet, it is hard to try, Hainanese chicken is slippery and delicious, recommended"
ChIJrfJo1McABDQRu0NSOoF6X_U,"Nice welcoming restaurant, the classic Thai food we ordered were very good: the Papaya salad, the soups, Green curry chicken etc. Fully recommend."
ChIJBcpPE8gABDQRedaVBUGEDJ8,"Love their naan with green curry!  Other dishes such as pan fried oysters with eggs, tom yum gong , and boneless chicken feet salad are delish as well!"
ChIJX8OnzSoHBDQRMUndZq_4fsQ,"It’s my second time here and I can definitely said it’s one of my first pick if you tell me to pick a Thai food restaurant in Hong Kong. It’s popularity has never stopped due to its price and standard of food that could be provided.
We came here on a weekday evening and it filled with people lining up and waiting for seats. Even after we finished, there are people still queuing...
we order a few of their signature dishes: stir-fried veggie, green curry with chicken, Hainan chicken (half portion), satay and of course nan bread! (My favorite!) the curry came with a stick of French bread when dipped in the green curry, it makes a delicious combination as the bread soaked with the sauce.
